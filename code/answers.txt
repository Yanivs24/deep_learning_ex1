
1) Yes. I got slightly better accuracies:
   - LogLinear: 86.66% accuracy on dev-test
   - MPL: 87.66% accuracy on dev-test

   That's make sense since the MLP can represents everythig that the LogLinear can.

2) With unigram features I got:
    - LogLinear: 71 %
    - MLP: 72%

3) My MLP learns the XOR function after 25-50 iteration with a suitable learning-rate.
